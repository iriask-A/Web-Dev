    <h1>One Art</h1>
    <p>The art of losing isn’t hard to master;<br>
so many things seem filled with the intent<br>
to be lost that their loss is no disaster.<br>
<br><br>
Lose something every day. Accept the fluster<br>
of lost door keys, the hour badly spent.<br>
The art of losing isn’t hard to master.<br>
<br><br>
Then practice losing farther, losing faster:<br>
places, and names, and where it was you meant<br>
to travel. None of these will bring disaster.</p>
